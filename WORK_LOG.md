| April 5      |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 25 | 1:50-2:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                      Right now I'm thinking of approaching the problem by turning the entire dictionary into a tree, where the children of each node are words that are built off of the original word. I'm not really sure how to keep track of where to go back to when I've exhausted one lineage though. |
| September 25 | 2:30-3:00pm |                                                                                                                                                               I spent a lot of time caught up on how to deal with single letter words. Then I talked to Mr. Blick and realized that I should just treat them like any other word, and if one of them doesn't exist, such as "b", just wait till i get something that starts with "b" and then make the path that includes b. |
| September 26 | 8:10-8:40pm |                    I think my search tree is building correctly with only words with normal letters. Have not yet added apostrophes. Now I'm working on searching that tree to check if a word is a valid word or not. My plan is to go letter by letter, traversing the tree until I reach a null letter, or until I have traversed the whole word. If its null, i'll just return false, but if i've traversed the whole word, I'll then check if the word is valid or not. |
| September 26 | 8:40-9:10pm |                                                                                   I passed testSentence! It took a lot of debugging, but I got my search function to work. For a while I was adding every word, because I wasn't checking the validity of the word at the end of the word, I was checking it at every letter. Also, I kept adding a bunch of copies of the same words because I wasn't breaking out of my for loop. With these fixed, I passed testSentence. |
| September 26 | 9:10-9:40pm | More progress! I added in checking for apostrophes, and am still working out filtering out words which have strange characters like accents and whatnot. Also, my way of checking for duplicates is not very good right now. It scales with how many words are already incorrect, which worsens with time. My plan is to implement a variable associated with each node which will store whether it's been added to the list yet, which should give me constant time lookup. |
